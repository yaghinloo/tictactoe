by Hadi Yaghinloo

please open the index.html file in a browser and have fun.

 the logic can handle a game with any given size. so far, this version is 3x3

the ES6 js file is in src folder. to let the code working on all browsers
I have added a simple build to transpile the ES6 code.

if we need to apply more changes to js file we need to follow this :

    npm install
    npm run build
