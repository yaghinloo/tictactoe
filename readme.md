**Simple TIC TAC TOE**

by Hadi Yaghinloo

please open the tictactoe.html file in a browser and have fun.
the logic to determine the winer is not implemented in this version

the ES6 js file is in src folder. to let the code working on all browsers
I have added a simple build to transpile the ES6 code.

if we need to apply more changes to js file we need to follow this :

    npm install
    npm run build
